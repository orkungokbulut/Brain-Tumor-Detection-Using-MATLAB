Brain Tumor Detection Using Image Processing Filters 

In order to find the tumors on brain MRI images, these image processing filters are applied to image sequently.

I used a few data from this dataset which label is 'yes', to test the code:

```
Gray Scale
Salt-Pepper Noise 
Median Filter
Canny Edge Detection 
Combining Canny and Original Image
Thresholding
Morphological Processes
Drawing bounding boxes and center detection of the tumor
```
